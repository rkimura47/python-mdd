## Development

This repo is set up using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), a Jupyter
notebook-driven software development platform especially suited to
creating Python packages with extensive, high-quality documentation.
Additionally, the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/) files
provide a complete containerized JupyterLab environment for development.

At a high level, the development workflow of nbdev can be summarized as
follows:

1.  Directly edit module source code / documentation in notebook files
    in `nbs/`.
2.  “Restart the kernel and run all cells” to run the entire Notebook
    and check for errors.
3.  Check the generated documentation via `nbdev_preview`.
4.  Once you’re ready to commit changes, run the entire notebook, save,
    close it, then confirm via Git.
    1.  You can also manually run `nbdev_prepare`.

Notably, `README.md` and the files in `python_mdd/` should NOT be
manually edited; instead, they should be generated based on notebook
files in `nbs/`.

See the [nbdev documentation](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/) for
additional details on software development using nbdev.

To spin up the containerized JupyterLab server, run (from the repo root)

``` sh
docker compose up server
```

To take it down, run (from the repo root)

``` sh
docker compose down
```

Some notable quirks of this particular containerized setup:

- `nbdev_preview` is configured to output to `0.0.0.0:3000` (and will
  say so in the console output), but it’s actually outputting to
  `localhost:3000` (from the perspective of the host machine). This is
  due to the command being run from within a container.
- The outputs of Jupyter notebooks are cleaned on save via nbdev’s
  Jupyter hook. Note that this may not be (is usually not) immediately
  reflected in the JupyterLab web interface.
- On container start-up, the repo package is installed in editable mode
  with the command `pip install -e '.[dev]'` to ensure it can be
  accessed from any notebook.

Alternatively, any software development environment set up to work with
the nbdev platform should also be sufficient.
